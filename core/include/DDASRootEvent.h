/** 
 * @class DDASRootEvent
 * @brief Encapsulates a built DDAS event with added capabilities for writing 
 * to ROOT files.
 * @details
 * Any data that was written to disk downstream of the NSCLDAQ event builder 
 * will have a "built" structure. What that means is that the body of the 
 * physics event item will contain data from more than one DDAS hit. 
 * The DDASRootEvent class represents this type of data. It provides access to 
 * the events that make it up through the DDASRootHit objects it owns and then 
 * also provides some useful methods for getting data from the event as a 
 * whole. 
 * 
 * The class is, as the name suggests, suitable for ROOT I/O. It inherits from 
 * ROOT's TObject and contains a `ClassDef()` macro which adds some reflection 
 * capability, allows for schema evolution and _in theory_ offers some 
 * performance benefit.
 *
 * @todo (ASC 4/2/24): Write tests for this class to validate its methods.
