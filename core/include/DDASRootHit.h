/**
 * @class DDASRootHit
 * @brief Encapsulation of a generic DDAS hit with added capabilities for 
 * writing to ROOT files.
 * @details
 * The DDASRootHit class is intended to encapsulate the information that is 
 * emitted by the Pixie-16 digitizer for a single hit from a single channel. 
 * It is generic because it can store data for the 100 MSPS, 250 MSPS, and 
 * 500 MSPS Pixie-16 digitizers used at the lab. In general all of these 
 * contain the same set of information, however, the meaning of the CFD data 
 * is different for each. The DDASRootHit class abstracts these differences 
 * away from the user.
 *
 * This is a very, very simple class. It inherits from ddasfmt::DDASHit and 
 * ROOT's TObject class and adds a ROOT `ClassDef()` macro. Everything else, 
 * including copy construction, assignment, etc. is handled "for free" by the 
 * base classes. Because the class inherits from ddasfmt::DDASHit, we can 
 * trivially use the ddasfmt::DDASHitUnpacker to unpack the event data 
 * directly into the ddasfmt::DDASHit members. 
 * 
 * @note In previous versions of NSCLDAQ (prior to 12.1), this class is called 
 * ddaschannel and is part of the libddaschannel library. The class is now 
 * called DDASRootHit to make more clear its relationship to the DDASHit class,
 * which it is derived from. The library which contains the ROOT I/O classes 
 * is now called libddasrootformat to better reflect its purpose.
 *
 * @note No namespace because we are going to refactor everything anyway...
